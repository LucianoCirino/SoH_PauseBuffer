This ahk script allows you to "pause buffer" inputs in Ship of Harkinian (SoH, aka OoT PC Port). 
It achieves it by changing your controller configuration in SoH to "Keyboard" temporarily during unpause
and then swapping it back to "Xbox Controller" once unpaused.

✶ Controls:
	• DPAD_UP: 			Pause/Frame Advance Pause
	• DPAD_LEFT: 			Save State
	• DPAD_DOWN: 			Next State
	• DPAD_DOWN: 			Load State
	• DPAD_DOWN + DPAD_START: 	Game Reset

⚠ Warnings:
	• Script only works if you have 3 options in SoH Controller Configuration: Xbox Controller, Keyboard, & Disconnect
	• These controls must be default for the script to function properly: Keyboard/Controller "Start", Keyboard/Controller "Z"
	• Frame Advance repause will fail if you are pressing start on controller while game is unpausing
	• Frame Advance repause will "sometimes" fail to trigger  (area dependant?)
	• Input buffers will fail if you unpause by Saving Game
	• If script isn't responding, try closing (1)Delfinovin, (2)SoH, & (3)Script, and then reopen them in that order
	• Script currently only works on SoH Rachael Bravo 3.0.1
