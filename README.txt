This ahk script allows you to "pause buffer" inputs in the Ship of Harkinian (SoH) OoT PC Port. 
It achieves it by changing P1's controller status in SoH to "Keyboard" temporarily during unpause
and then swapping it back to the first listed "Controller" once unpaused.

ðŸŽ® Controls:
	â€¢ DPAD_UP: 			Pause/Frame Advance Pause
	â€¢ DPAD_LEFT: 			Save State
	â€¢ DPAD_DOWN: 			Next State
	â€¢ DPAD_DOWN: 			Load State
	â€¢ DPAD_DOWN + DPAD_START: 	Game Reset

âœ” Supported Version(s):
        â€¢ Ship of Harkinian: Rachael Bravo 3.0.1

âš  Warnings:
	â€¢ Script was designed to be used with an XInput Controller (Gamecube + Delfinovin for example).
	â€¢ These controls must be default for the script to function: Keyboard/Controller "Start", Keyboard/Controller "Z".
        â€¢ Frame Advance repause will fail if you are pressing start on controller while game is unpausing.
	â€¢ Frame Advance repause will "sometimes" fail to trigger (area dependant?).
	â€¢ Input buffers will fail if you unpause by Saving Game.

ðŸŒŸ Other:
	â€¢ To change Links's Z-Lock status or target, press the Z-Lock button AFTER having begun unpausing.
        â€¢ To keep Links Z-Lock status, hold the Z-Lock button BEFORE unpausing.
