This ahk script allows you to "pause buffer" inputs in the Ship of Harkinian (SoH) OoT PC Port. 
It achieves it by changing P1's controller status in the SoH Controller Configuration to "Keyboard" 
during unpause and then swapping it back to the first listed "Controller" once unpaused.

ðŸŽ® Controls:
	â€¢ DPAD_UP: 			Pause/Frame Advance Pause
	â€¢ DPAD_LEFT: 			Save State
	â€¢ DPAD_DOWN: 			Next State
	â€¢ DPAD_RIGHT: 			Load State
	â€¢ DPAD_DOWN + DPAD_START: 	Game Reset

ðŸŒŸ Notes:
	â€¢ These controls must match in order for the script to function as intended:
	  Keyboard:   	 N64 "Start" = {Space bar}  |  N64 "Z"   = {Z}
	  Controller#1:  N64 "Start" = {Button 6}   |  N64 "Z"   = {Button 9}
	
âœ” Supported Version(s):
        â€¢ Ship of Harkinian: Rachael Bravo 3.0.1

âš  Warnings:
	â€¢ Script was designed to be used with an XInput Controller (Gamecube + Delfinovin for example).
	â€¢ Frame Advance repause will fail if you are pressing start on controller while game is unpausing.
	â€¢ Input buffers will fail if you unpause by Saving Game.
